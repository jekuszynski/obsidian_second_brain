# A catalog of things I want to remember. Things that are important.
- [[Daily/#2021-01-08]] I want to meditate more. I want to remember what it means to be present and to not give in to alluring temptation of searching for purpose or discovery, when it doesn't exist. It only exists if we create it. We only create it if we're unsatisfied. We're only unsatisfied if aren't content in the present. Hence the attachment to the past and future. I want to be here now. The more *here* I am, the less I need and the less I desire for a time or place other than here. That's what was so beautiful about [[Soviet]]. It was perfect. It needed nothing more than what it was. Yet while sober I crave everything but what I am and have.
- [[Writing]] is such an incredibly important tool. By writing out my thoughts, I am able to learn them to a much greater degree. Try not to quote too much, rather reframe in your own words.
