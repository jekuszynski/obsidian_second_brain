- Atomic particles posses components
	- Electron Magnetic Dipole
	- Orbital Motion
	- Positively Charged Nucleus (Protons) Electrostatic Field
- Effect can spectroscopically be seen as a splitting of electronic orbitals (similar to [[Zeeman Effect]])
	- Splitting is caused the product of the local magnetic field (from the perspective of the electron), and the electron magnetic dipole (spin +/- 1/2)


### Spin Magnetic Moment
$$\mathbf{\mu}_S=-g_s\mu_B\frac{\mathbf{S}}{\mathbf{\hbar}}$$
- $\mathbf{S}$ is the spin angular-momentum vector
- $\mu_B$ is the [[Bohr Magneton]]
- $g_s$ is approximately 2, the electron-spin [[g-factor]]
