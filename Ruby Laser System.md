- Transition metal Cr3+ has a d3 electron configuration, resulting in octahedral geometry for ground state. (t2g and eg)

- Because Cr3+ site symmetry is lower than octahedral due to a distortion along a cube axis for the [[Al2O3]] lattice, both 4T1 and 4T2 can be excited, relaxing into the 2E state which consists of two energy levels at 29 cm^-1 difference. 
	- The Primary "R1" emission line from 2E to ground state is the 694.3 nm laser "ruby" line. 
- Classic example of a [[Three Level Laser System]]
	- Because weaker than a [[Four Level Laser System]], stronger pumping is required.

- [[Lifetime]] is strongly temperature dependent, and becomes shorter at higher temps due to greater thermal population of the 4T2 state.
	- More population, less time needed for transition to occur.  
	- Also, [[phonons]] are more energetically accessible at higher temperatures, allowing for a decrease in lifetime due to increasing probability of competing pathway.
