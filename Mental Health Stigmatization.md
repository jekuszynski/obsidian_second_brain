## Stigma Sources
- Can originate from Mental Health Practitioners (MHPs)

## Addressing Stigma
- 90% of those aged 14-22 who had symptoms of [[depression]] searched online for personal anecdotes. 
	- Perhaps trying to find someone to relate to?
	- Write up anecdotal stories about other FSUstudents with a wide varient of menatl health issuse? Host it on my.fsu.edu? - akin to [src](https://www.howareyoureally.org/home)
- "Social marketing campaigns can also be effective. For example, [a research study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6595511/) looked at the effectiveness of an anti-stigma social marketing campaign in California and found that the campaign increased service use by helping people better understand symptoms of distress and increasing awareness that help is available. The researchers estimated that if all adults with probable mental illness were exposed to the California mental health campaign, 47% would receive mental health treatment. If the same adults were not exposed to the campaign, 36% would receive treatment." -[src](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/stigma-and-discrimination )
	- [[SOCIAL MARKETING]]
		- **Akin to Facebook sending radical fake news posts to those who want it, why not use the same principle for those who exhibit symptoms of distress/inhibited mental health?**
		- To make this work, some basic user info is needed:
			- What's the average wait time/browse time of all popular FSU webpages?
			- What links are clicked most often?
			- Canvas vs. my.fsu.edu? 
			- How can we seamlessly integrate some sort of informational button/advertisement 
				- Is there some question that can be asked to prompt the user clicking on the ad/button?
					- e.g. "How are you *really*?"
			- A/B testing features required
			- People are **always** on their phone. How can we use this to our advantage?
			- Could we ACTUALLY create an AD?
				- Is it possible to have ad's for localization? To pop up on phone apps, reddit, facebook, etc?
					- Even if possible, how do you subsidize? 
				- Narrative advertising more effective than argument based - [src](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18307135/)
	- Kognito for students?
		- Evidence based, hard to just skip and ignore if made compulsory.\
