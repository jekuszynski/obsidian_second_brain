### The Mission: "Be better than you were yesterday"

- Two meters, [[Physical Health]] and [[Mental Health]]
- There are four [[Zones]] to keep track of in life.
<ul>
	<li><b style='color:orange'>Exercise</b></li>
	<li><b style='color:purple'>Sleep</b></li>
	<li><b style='color:green'>Recreation</b></li>
	<li><b style='color:cyan'>Creation</b></li>
</ul>

- Prime with the physical.
	- <b><b style='color:orange'>Exercise</b> is non-optional.</b>
- You must get a handle on <b style='color:purple'>Sleep</b>. 
	- Wake up at same time every day.
